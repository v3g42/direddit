### Diggit

This project aims to create a digg/reddit clone where users can upvote or downvote list of topics.

### Implementation

Breaking down into frontend and backend modules.
As we are not really worried about things like persistence and state management on the web server, 
server can be a simple embedded web server serving REST APIs and static files and a featured SPA can
be used to build the frontend.

- Java Spark (Uses an embedded Jetty server and gives a simple API to create routes.)
- AngularJS 1 

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 (IntelliJ/Eclipse)
- Maven
